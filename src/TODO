Add instance variable useWeatherAdjust
- if true, getTimeRemaining should use it to set remaining time
-- NOT to set zones duration
- Also should include a setting too to set by user?
- startWatering shouldn't use weatherAdjustRate
-- Maybe startWatering should change mode to manual and then change back to auto when finished?
--- weatherAdjustRate should check if in auto mode before being used?
