Add offline file
	.json
		easier to store same as API call structure
	use littleFS
	Everytime setting is changed via API call, the offline is also changed
	On restart, the offline file is called to get settings

Change settings to store settings for more than one LawnManager
Create ProgramManager
	controls multiple zonemanagers
	Change zonemanager to not start watering, but to instead change state to "shouldStart"
	The programManager iterates through zonemanagers, and starts one when it shouldStart.
		It will then complete and have isStarted() as false"
		If another zoneManager also has "shouldStart" nothing happens if isWatering()
			so it waits for the other one to finish

class ZoneManager(int pins[]) {
public:
	shouldFinish()
	shouldStart()
	startWatering()
	stopWatering()
}

class ProgramManager
	bool _isWatering;
